# Massive ads blocklist project ![Alpaca Approved](http://url/to/img.png)

This list joins multiple ads blocklists into one. Why you ask? I was lazy and did not want to input multiple blocklist to my Pi Hole. The list will be updated on a weekley basis. The main goal was blocking YouTube ads on my Xiaomi Mi Box S. The list includes both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses as well as domain names and other stuff.
