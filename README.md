# Massive ads blocklist project

This list joins multiple ads blocklist into one. Why you ask? I was lazy and did not want to input multiple blocklist to my Pi Hole. The list will be updated on a weekley basis. The main goal was blocking YouTube ads on my Xiaomi Mi Box S. The list includes both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses.
